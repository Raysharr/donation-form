## 🧪 Run Tests

- Currently only lib utilities are tested to present my ability to set up tests
  environment and write couple essential tests.

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- Vite, React, Typescript, Styled-components, Unplugin-fonts/vite (google fonts
  loading optimization)

## 🤔 Assumptions

- I focused on creating the smallest bundle size as I could, thats why all
  components like `<MoneyInput />` was created by hand.
- SEO is not a thing here that's why I have picked client side rendering
  approach.
- There were no requirements regarding compatibility with web browsers,
  therefore the code was manually tested only in modern browsers.
- In terms of languages currently only english language support is provided
